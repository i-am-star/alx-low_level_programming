<h1 align = "center">MEMORY ALLOCATION IN C</h1>

Memory allocation is the process of setting aside or reserving sections or parts of memory in a program to be used to store variables, and instances of structures and classes.

There are two types of memory allocation: 
- Static memory allocation: In static memory allocation, the memory is allocated(distributed or set aside) at compilation time. 
i.e during the compilation process of the c source code, the allocated size is fixed and cannot be changed or modified, except the programmer goes back to the source code, modifies the file, and recompiles it again.

- Dynamic memory allocation: In dynamic memory allocation, the memory is distributed at runtime.
i.e during the compilation process of the c source code, memory can be allocated or deallocated according to programming needs. This type of memory allocation allows for efficeient use of memory space. Dynamic memory allocation is done from the heap.
