- What is the ASCII character set
- What are the purpose of the gcc flags -m32 and -m64

## Variables in C
A variable is a container that is used to store or hold values. When a variable is created, space is allocated inside the memory for that value, and how much space that is allocated to a variable all depends on the type of value it will hold.

To use a variable, we declare it and assign a value to it. For exapmle to declare a variable that will contain an integer number:

`			int num = 20;					`
