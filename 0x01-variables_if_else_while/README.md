## Variables in C
A variable is a container that is used to store or hold values. When a variable is created, space is allocated inside the memory for that value, and what type a value is determines how much space is allocated to the variable.

To use a variable, we declare it and assign a value to it. For exapmle to declare a variable that will contain an integer number:

` int num = 20; `
