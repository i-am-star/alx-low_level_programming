## Operators in C (Arithmetic operators, Logical operators, Relational operators)

Operators are special symbols used to perform certain mathematical and logical functions in C. They are Arithmetic Operators, relational Operators, logical Operators, bitwise Operators, assignment Operators, etc.

- *Arithemetic operator:* This operator performs mathematical and arithemetic opearations on operands. They are of two types, unary operators and binary operators. unary operators carry out operation on single operands. Examples of this type of operator are increment and decrement operators (++, --) The increment operator increases a value by one, and the decrement operator decreases the value by one. Binary operators carryout operations on two values. they are addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), and division (/) operators.

## Variables in C
A variable is a container that is used to store or hold values. When a variable is created, space is allocated inside the memory for that value, and how much space that is allocated to a variable all depends on the type of value it will hold.

To use a variable, we declare it and assign a value to it. For exapmle to declare a variable that will contain an integer number:

`			int num = 20;					`
