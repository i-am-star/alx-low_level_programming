Debugging is the process of finding and removing bugs(errors) in computer programs. It involves identifying a problem, isolating the source of the problem and then either correcting the problem or determining a way to work around it. The final step of debugging is to test the correction or workaround and make sure it works.

## Tasks

**0. Multiple mains**

Based on the main.c file above, create a file named 0-main.c. This file must test that the function positive_or_negative() gives the correct output when given a case of 0.

- You are not coding the solution / function, you’re just testing it! However, you can adapt your function from 0x01. C - Variables, if, else, while - Task #0 to compile with this main file to test locally.

- You only need to upload 0-main.c and main.h for this task. We will provide our own positive_or_negative() function.
- You are not allowed to add or remove lines of code, you may change only one line in this task.

solution: [0-main.c](https://github.com/i-am-star/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x03-debugging/0-main.c)
---


**1. Like, comment, subscribe**

Copy this main file. Comment out (don’t delete it!) the part of the code that is causing the output to go into an infinite loop.

- Don’t add or remove any lines of code, as we will be checking your line count. You are only allowed to comment out existing code.
- You do not have to compile with -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic for this task.
